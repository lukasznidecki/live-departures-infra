# Multi-Cloud Configuration Example
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize for your deployment

# Cloud Provider Selection (required)
# Options: "gcp" or "aws"
cloud_provider = "gcp"

# Cluster Configuration (required)
cluster_name = "live-departures-cluster"

# GCP Configuration (only used when cloud_provider = "gcp")
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
region     = "europe-west4"

# AWS Configuration (only used when cloud_provider = "aws")
aws_region = "us-west-2"

# Example configurations for different scenarios:

## For GCP deployment:
# cloud_provider = "gcp"
# project_id = "my-project-123456"
# region = "europe-west4"
# cluster_name = "my-gke-cluster"

## For AWS deployment:
# cloud_provider = "aws"
# aws_region = "us-west-2"
# cluster_name = "my-eks-cluster"
